# How to run
* Setup the environment `virtualenv -p python2.7 venv`
* `. ./<project>/venv/activate`
* Point Pycharm at the environment and make sure that it's global (seems to be the best way to get it to work).
* Create a `config.py` file with `key`, `secret`, and `passphrase` entries from the API setup.
* Should be able to run from there.
